## Route Description

### Approach

**Trailhead:** Cold Springs Campground (5,560 ft elevation)

**Access:** From Trout Lake, WA, take Mt Adams Road north to Forest Road 23. Stay right at the V intersection and continue approximately one mile to Forest Road 80 (signed "South Climb"). Turn left onto FR 80 and follow to its end at FR 8040/8031 intersection. Turn right onto FR 8040 and continue north past Morrison Creek Campground to the South Climb Trailhead in the old Cold Springs Camp area.

**Road Conditions:** The road requires good clearance and All Wheel Drive year-round, with Four Wheel Drive recommended. The road is steep and narrow with sharp switchbacks. No RVs or trailers. Roads within Gifford Pinchot National Forest are subject to seasonal closure in winter months.

### Standard Route: South Climb (South Spur)

Mount Adams' South Climb is the most popular and easiest route to the summit. Despite being non-technical, this is a serious mountaineering objective with significant elevation gain and exposure to weather.

The route begins on the South Climb Trail (#183) from Cold Springs, traversing through a 2012 burn zone before crossing Morrison Creek (reliable water source). The trail climbs rocky terrain and switchbacks up through talus fields and lava formations, gaining approximately 2,000 feet before reaching the ridgeline around 7,400 ft.

From the ridgeline, the route becomes fully exposed to weather and winds. Snow coverage typically begins around 8,000 ft. Most climbers camp at the Lunch Counter (9,400 ft), a popular high camp with established tent platforms. Water is available below Lunch Counter and at Morrison Creek.

From Lunch Counter, climbers ascend the main south snowfield or Suksdorf Ridge (western option) toward Pikers Peak (11,657 ft) - a prominent false summit. The snowfield maintains a moderate but consistent gradient. In summer, well-established boot pack makes route-finding straightforward. Winter and early season conditions require more navigation skills.

After cresting Pikers Peak, a flat traverse crosses to the final summit push - a steep section of dirt, sand, and loose rock switchbacks reminiscent of Mount St. Helens. The true summit lies approximately 0.5 miles beyond Pikers Peak.

**Key Details:**

- **Distance:** 12-14 miles round trip (sources vary slightly)
- **Elevation Gain:** 6,600-6,700 ft
- **Estimated Time:**
  - Fast pace (2+ mph, 1000+ ft/hr): 7-9 hours car-to-car
  - Moderate pace (1.5-2 mph, 700-900 ft/hr): 10-12 hours car-to-car
  - Leisurely pace / 2-day trip: Most climbers take 2 days with overnight at Lunch Counter

### Crux

The crux varies by season and conditions. In summer/fall after snow has melted, the final summit push from Pikers Peak involves 600+ ft of steep, loose dirt and sand switchbacks. The terrain is tedious and physically demanding but not technical - similar to scree climbing on other Cascade volcanoes.

In winter and early season with full snow coverage, the steeper sections of the south snowfield (particularly approaching Pikers Peak) become the crux. While the angle rarely exceeds 35-40 degrees, icy conditions above 11,000 ft demand crampons and competent ice axe technique. The exposure increases near Pikers Peak, and a fall could result in a long slide.

Route-finding can be challenging in whiteout conditions, darkness, or when the boot pack is obscured. GPS navigation skills are valuable for these conditions.

### Hazards & Safety

**Known Hazards:**

- **Weather Exposure:** Above 7,400 ft, the route is fully exposed to high winds and rapidly changing weather. Multiple reports mention brutal winds near the summit. Climbers must be prepared for overnight stays in adverse conditions.

- **False Summit (Pikers Peak):** Psychologically and physically demanding. After hours of climbing, reaching what appears to be the summit only to face another 0.5+ miles of elevation gain has turned back many climbers.

- **Icy Conditions:** Above 11,000 ft, snow and ice can be firm to icy, especially in morning hours and late season. Microspikes are marginal in these conditions; crampons strongly recommended.

- **Rock Hazards:** The final dirt/rock scramble has loose rock. Helmets are advised. One recent trip report mentioned being struck by a sliding rock, narrowly avoiding a concussion.

- **Route-Finding:** In darkness, whiteout, or late season when snow has patchy coverage, route-finding becomes more challenging. Some sections have cairns, but these can be unreliable.

- **Crevasses:** While the South Climb is considered the least glaciated route, the mountain has active glaciers and climbers should be aware of crevasse hazards, particularly if deviating from the standard route.

- **Altitude:** At 12,280 ft, altitude sickness is possible, especially for climbers coming from sea level.

- **Crowding:** In peak season (June-August), the Lunch Counter can have 30+ tents, and the trail sees heavy traffic. This increases rockfall hazard from climbers above.

**Required Gear:**

- Ice axe and crampons (essential for snow sections)
- Helmet (recommended for rock hazard)
- Microspikes (marginal - crampons preferred)
- Trekking poles
- Ten Essentials plus overnight gear if camping
- GPS device or map/compass for navigation

## Current Conditions

### Daylight

- **Date:** 2025-11-06
- **Sunrise:** 6:53 AM PST
- **Sunset:** 4:45 PM PST (next day)
- **Daylight Hours:** 9 hours, 52 minutes
- **Civil Twilight:** 6:23 AM - 5:15 PM (optimal window for alpine starts and activities)

**Considerations:** With under 10 hours of daylight in early November, alpine starts are critical for summit attempts. Most climbers aim to start from Lunch Counter at 3-4 AM to ensure summit and descent in daylight.

### Weather Forecast

**7-Day Forecast** (November 6-12, 2025):

**Current Storm (Thu-Fri, Nov 6-7):**

- Heavy snow and precipitation

Microspikes on approach shoes caused toe issues on steep rock descent. Emphasized helmet importance after rock slide incident. Encountered unprepared climbers on Crescent Glacier. Recommended calling Trout Lake Forest Service office before trip for conditions.

- **2025-08-31** - [Abraham Guz](https://www.peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=2967425) - Alpine start from Lunch Counter (3 AM). Mixed rock and snow route.
