## Overview

Wolf Peak rises to **5,813 ft (1,772 m)** with 257 ft (78 m) of prominence in the Snohomish County, Washington Cascades. The peak is located at 48.016465°N, -121.513745°W ([Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=48.016465,-121.513745) | [USGS Topo](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/topoview/viewer/#17/48.016465/-121.513745)). The standard route is a **scramble** rated **Class 2-3 with an exposed Class 3-4 summit block**.

Wolf Peak is a challenging scramble situated between Vesper Peak and Sperry Peak in the North Cascades. The route follows well-traveled trail to Headlee Pass and Vesper Lake, then transitions to off-trail scrambling across granite slabs and boulders to reach the ridge between Wolf and Sperry. The final summit block features highly exposed, technical moves that require solid scrambling skills and comfort with significant exposure.

## Route

### Approach

**Sunrise Mine Trailhead** (2,350 ft) - Snohomish County, Washington

**Directions:** From Granite Falls, drive the Mountain Loop Highway approximately 28 miles east, then turn right onto Sunrise Mine Road (Forest Road 4065) for 2.3 miles to its end at the Sunrise Mine Trailhead. [View on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Sunrise+Mine+Trailhead+WA)

### Access & Permits

#### Permits & Regulations

A **Northwest Forest Pass** is required for parking at the Sunrise Mine Trailhead. No wilderness permit is required for day use.

#### Road Conditions

Mountain Loop Highway is typically open from late May through October, depending on snow levels. Sunrise Mine Road (FR 4065) can have potholes and rough sections but is generally passable by all vehicles in summer. Check current road conditions before your trip.

### Route Description

The route covers approximately **8 miles round trip** with **3,600 ft** of elevation gain.

**Typical completion times:**

- **2.5-3.5 hours** (~2+ mph, 1000+ ft/hr): Experienced scramblers, strong fitness
- **4-5 hours** (~1.5-2 mph, 700-900 ft/hr): Average fitness, steady pace with breaks
- **5-7 hours** (~1-1.5 mph, 500-700 ft/hr): Relaxed pace, groups, navigation challenges

From the Sunrise Mine Trailhead, follow the well-maintained trail 2.7 miles to Headlee Pass at 4,720 ft. The trail continues around the south flanks of Sperry Peak, descending slightly to reach Vesper Lake basin (approximately 4,950 ft) nestled between Sperry and Vesper Peaks.

From Vesper Lake, the route becomes off-trail. Multiple approaches exist to reach the Wolf-Sperry saddle:

**Approach Option 1** (most common): From the northwest corner of the lake, scramble up approximately 400 ft across granite slabs and boulders trending left (west) to gain a small saddle between Vesper Peak and Wolf Peak. From this saddle, traverse climber's right (north) along the ridge toward Wolf Peak's summit.

**Approach Option 2**: Go around the north side of the lake and scramble up slabby rock to reach the saddle between Wolf and Sperry directly.

The scrambling terrain is primarily **Class 2** walking on large granite slabs and boulders with some **Class 3** sections requiring basic hand and footwork. The rock is generally solid when dry but can be slippery when wet. Route-finding is straightforward in good visibility but GPS is highly recommended in fog.

As you near the summit, the terrain becomes more exposed. The final summit block requires careful assessment and presents the technical crux of the route.

### Crux

The crux is located at the final summit block and consists of an extremely exposed traverse followed by a technical move to reach the true summit. Climbers must cross a narrow, off-camber ledge approximately **4 feet wide with ~1,000 ft drop-offs on both sides**. This leads to a crack or gap between large summit boulders. The final move to tag the true summit is **Class 3-4** with severe exposure and fatal-fall consequences.

Multiple trip reports describe this section as "incredibly exposed," with one noting "hundreds if not thousands of feet of vertical drop on either side." The moves themselves are technically moderate when dry, but the psychological challenge is significant due to the exposure. Trip reports indicate parties frequently skip the final summit block or bring a rope for protection on this section.

### Hazards

**Route-finding in poor visibility:** The upper scramble section requires good visibility. Multiple trip reports mention GPS being essential in fog conditions. Cairns exist but can be difficult to follow in whiteout conditions.

**Exposure and rockfall:** The summit block features extreme exposure with fatal-fall potential. Loose blocks exist between the true and false summits. A helmet is recommended due to rockfall danger from parties above.

**Slippery conditions:** Granite slabs become significantly more hazardous when wet or icy. Early season conditions may require crampons and ice axe if snow-filled gullies are present.

**River crossing:** The approach involves a creek crossing that can be challenging during high water. In late fall and early spring, water levels may be significantly elevated, requiring careful navigation upstream to find safe crossing points.

**Weather exposure:** The upper basin and ridge sections are fully exposed to weather. Winter conditions arrive early (October-November) with knee to waist-deep snow accumulation above the lake requiring snowshoes, poles, and winter travel experience.

## Current Conditions

### Daylight

For **November 6, 2025**, sunrise is at **6:58 AM PST** and sunset at **4:41 PM PST**, providing **9 hours and 43 minutes** of daylight. Civil twilight begins at **6:26 AM PST**, useful for planning alpine starts.

### Weather Forecast

**⚠️ Active winter storm pattern in progress.** Today (Thursday, Nov 6) features heavy rain/snow mix with 100% precipitation probability and 33.8mm accumulation. Freezing levels hover near 1,700-2,200 ft, putting the summit in snow conditions. Friday continues with snow and temperatures dropping to single digits Fahrenheit. **Saturday-Sunday offer the best weather window** with mostly clear to partly cloudy skies, though temperatures remain cold (highs near 32-40°F). Monday brings rain back with moderate precipitation (68% chance). Overall, early week features **active winter conditions unsuitable for climbing**, while the weekend provides a brief clearing before the next system arrives Tuesday-Wednesday.

**Summary:** Best weather window is Saturday-Sunday (Nov 8-9) with clear conditions, but expect full winter conditions requiring appropriate gear.
