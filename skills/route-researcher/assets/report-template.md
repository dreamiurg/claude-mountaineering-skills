> - Use your own judgment and experience to assess conditions and risk
> - Cross-reference with current trip reports and local conditions
> - Understand that conditions change rapidly in the mountains

> **This is NOT a substitute for:**
> - Proper training and experience
> - Current weather and avalanche forecasts

## Overview

{Peak name} rises to **{elevation with units}** with {prominence with units} of prominence in the {state, range}. The peak is located at {latitude}, {longitude} ([Google Maps]({google_maps_coordinates_link}) | [USGS Topo]({usgs_topo_link})). The standard route is a **{route type}** rated **{difficulty}**.

{1-2 sentence synthesized description of the route character, typical approach, and what makes it notable or challenging. Example: "The route follows a classic alpine traverse combining glacier travel with moderate scrambling. Most parties complete the climb in a long day from the trailhead, navigating crevassed terrain on the approach glacier before tackling exposed rock near the summit."}

## Route

### Approach

{Trailhead name and location}

**Directions:** [View on Google Maps]({google_maps_link})

### Route

{Route description synthesized from multiple sources, incorporating: The route covers **{round trip distance}** with **{total gain}** of elevation gain, typically taking **{typical completion time}** to complete.}

### Crux

{One paragraph describing the hardest/most technical section:
- What makes it challenging
- Where it's located on route
- Skills/gear required for this section}

### Hazards

{Synthesized from multiple sources:
- Known hazards (crevasses, rockfall, exposure)
- Seasonal considerations
- Bailout options
- If trip reports mention unusual or important gear (e.g., "approach shoes recommended for talus" or "bring extra pickets"), include brief mention here}
