## Overview

{Peak name} rises to **{elevation with units}** with {prominence with units} of prominence in the {state, range}. The peak is located at {latitude}, {longitude} ([Google Maps]({google_maps_coordinates_link}) | [USGS Topo]({usgs_topo_link})). The standard route is a **{route type}** rated **{difficulty}**.

{1-2 sentence synthesized description of the route character, typical approach, and what makes it notable or challenging. Example: "The route follows a classic alpine traverse combining glacier travel with moderate scrambling. Most parties complete the climb in a long day from the trailhead, navigating crevassed terrain on the approach glacier before tackling exposed rock near the summit."}

## Route

### Approach

{Trailhead name and location}

**Directions:** [View on Google Maps]({google_maps_link})

### Route

{Route description synthesized from multiple sources}

The route covers approximately **{round trip distance}** with **{total gain}** of elevation gain.

**Typical completion times:**
- **{fast time range}** (~{fast mph} mph, {fast gain rate}+ ft/hr): Experienced hikers, trail runners, solo climbers
- **{moderate time range}** (~{moderate mph} mph, {moderate gain rate} ft/hr): Average fitness, steady pace with brief breaks
- **{leisurely time range}** (~{leisurely mph} mph, {leisurely gain rate} ft/hr): Relaxed pace, groups, taking time for photos

{Continue with detailed route description}

### Crux

{Format with bold highlights for key details. Structure:
- Lead with location if known
- Highlight difficulty rating, exposure level, key technical requirements
- Call out conditions that make it harder (wet, snow, etc.)
- Mention required skills/gear

Example format:
"The crux is located **near the summit at approximately 4,900 ft**, where climbers must navigate a rock band via a **Class 2-3 gully**. This section requires **basic scrambling skills** and can be more challenging **when wet or icy**. In early season conditions, the gully may be **snow-filled, requiring crampons and ice axe skills**. The **exposure is moderate** but the rock can be **loose**, requiring careful route-finding and attention to hand/foot placements."

Use bold for: locations, difficulty grades, exposure descriptions, conditions, required skills/gear, key hazards}

### Hazards

{Synthesized from multiple sources:
- Known hazards (crevasses, rockfall, exposure)
- Seasonal considerations
- Bailout options
- If trip reports mention unusual or important gear (e.g., "approach shoes recommended for talus" or "bring extra pickets"), include brief mention here}

## Current Conditions

### Daylight

{If available from API:}
For **{date}**, sunrise is at **{time}** and sunset at **{time}**, providing **{hours}** of daylight. Civil twilight begins at **{civil_twilight_begin}**, useful for planning alpine starts.

{If not available:}
Daylight calculations not available. Check sunrise/sunset times for your planned date at [Sunrise-Sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org/us/{location}) or [TimeAndDate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/).

### Weather Forecast

{Synthesized summary paragraph with bold formatting for key details. Structure:
- Describe overall pattern (stable/transitioning/stormy)
- Highlight weather windows, storms, precipitation timing
- Note temperature trends, freezing levels, snow levels
- Call out significant hazards (high winds, heavy precip, rapid changes)

Example format:
"The forecast shows a transition from **relatively dry conditions** to a **wet, cold pattern arriving mid-week**. Tuesday afternoon is **mostly sunny and calm (48°F high)**, but a weather system brings **rain Wednesday through Friday** with **increasing precipitation chances**. Snow levels will drop significantly by Friday, **transitioning to snow at summit elevations**. The weekend looks particularly challenging with **heavy snow possible** and temperatures in the **low 30s°F**."

Use bold for: weather patterns, precipitation types/timing, temperature ranges, snow levels, wind conditions, weather windows, significant hazards}

**Summary:** {One sentence actionable summary - best weather window or caution to avoid certain days}

{If freezing level is within 2000 ft of peak elevation during forecast period:}
**🏔️ Freezing Level Alert (Peak: {elevation} ft):**
- {Day range}: {freezing level} ft ({above/at/below summit} - expect {dry/mixed/snow} conditions)
- {Day range}: {freezing level} ft ({above/at/below summit} - expect {dry/mixed/snow} conditions)

{Example for 5,469 ft peak with dropping freezing levels:}
**🏔️ Freezing Level Alert (Peak: 5,469 ft):**
- Mon-Tue: 8,000+ ft (well above summit - expect dry conditions)
- Wed-Thu: 6,000-7,000 ft (borderline - rain/snow mix possible)
- Fri-Sun: 5,000-5,500 ft (AT or BELOW summit - expect snow)

{Omit this section entirely if freezing level stays >2000 ft above peak throughout forecast period - not relevant for summer conditions}

| Day | Conditions | Temperature | Precipitation |
|-----|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| {DayOfWeek} {Mon} {Day} {21}, {2025} (Today) | {Conditions} | High: {temp}°F | {Precip amount/chance} |
| {DayOfWeek} {Mon} {Day} {22}, {2025} | {Conditions} | High: {temp}°F, Low: {temp}°F | {Precip amount/chance} |
| {DayOfWeek} {Mon} {Day} {23}, {2025} | {Conditions} | High: {temp}°F, Low: {temp}°F | {Precip amount/chance} |

| {DayOfWeek} {Mon} {Day} {26}, {2025} | {Conditions} | High: {temp}°F, Low: {temp}°F | {Precip amount/chance} |

{Format notes:
- Use actual calendar dates from the report generation date
- Include year (2025) for clarity
- Mark first day as "(Today)" if appropriate
- Use day-of-week abbreviations: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
