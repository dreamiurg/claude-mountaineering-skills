# Trip Report Collector Agent

**Purpose:** Retrieve ascent statistics, discover trip report sources, and fetch 10-15 representative trip reports for route analysis.

**Expected Execution Time:** 120-240 seconds (depends on number of reports to fetch)

## Input

Receive peak data:
```json
{
  "peak_id": "1798",
  "peak_name": "Mount Baker",
  "coordinates": {
    "latitude": 48.7768,
    "longitude": -121.8144
  }
}
```

## Output

Return JSON matching `schemas/trip-reports-data.json` with ascent statistics and trip reports.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Get Ascent Statistics (PeakBagger)

1. **Overall Statistics:**
   ```bash
   uvx --from git+https://github.com/dreamiurg/peakbagger-cli.git@v1.7.0 peakbagger peak stats {peak_id} --format json
   ```

   Extract:
   - Total ascent count
   - Seasonal distribution
   - Count with GPX tracks
   - Count with trip reports

2. **Determine Timeframe** based on popularity:
   - **Popular peaks (>50 ascents):** Use `--within 1y` (recent data sufficient)
   - **Moderate peaks (10-50 ascents):** Use `--within 5y` (need more sample)
   - **Rare peaks (<10 ascents):** Use all available data (no filter)

3. **Get Detailed Ascent List:**
   ```bash
   uvx --from git+https://github.com/dreamiurg/peakbagger-cli.git@v1.7.0 peakbagger peak ascents {peak_id} --format json --within {timeframe}
   ```

   Extract for each ascent:
   - Date
   - Climber name
   - Trip report word count
   - Has GPX (boolean)
   - Ascent URL

### Phase 2: Discover Trip Report Sources (Parallel WebSearch)

Run simultaneously:

```
WebSearch queries:
1. "{peak_name} site:wta.org" - WTA hike page
2. "{peak_name} site:alltrails.com" - AllTrails page
3. "{peak_name} site:summitpost.org" - SummitPost route page
4. "{peak_name} site:mountaineers.org" - Mountaineers route page
5. "{peak_name} trip report site:cascadeclimbers.com" - Forum discussions
```

Save URLs for "Browse All" section.

### Phase 3: Identify Trip Reports to Fetch

**Selection Strategy:** Representative sample of 10-15 reports

**From PeakBagger (use data from Phase 1):**
- Filter: `trip_report.word_count > 0`
- Sort by date (most recent first)
- Select:
  - 5-10 recent reports (last 1-2 years)
  - 2-5 older reports with unique insights
  - Prioritize reports with GPX when available
  - Mix of seasons if available

**From WTA (if URL found in Phase 2):**

Use AJAX endpoint:
```bash
cd skills/route-researcher/tools
uv run python cloudscrape.py "{wta_url}/@@related_tripreport_listing"
```

Parse HTML to extract:
- Date
- Author/title
- Trip report URL

Target 10-15 individual URLs, prioritize recent with variety.

**From Mountaineers.org (if URL found in Phase 2):**

Use trip-reports endpoint:
```bash
cd skills/route-researcher/tools
uv run python cloudscrape.py "{mountaineers_url}/trip-reports"
```

Parse HTML to extract:
- Date
- Title
- Author
- Trip report URL

Select top 3-5 most recent.

### Phase 4: Fetch Trip Report Content (10-15 Total)

**Selection for fetching:**
- Recent reports (last 1-2 years) for current conditions
- Mix of sources (PeakBagger, WTA, Mountaineers)
- Variety of dates/seasons
- Include some with GPX tracks (provides downloadable route data)

**PeakBagger Reports:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/dreamiurg/peakbagger-cli.git@v1.7.0 peakbagger ascent show {ascent_id} --format json
```

**WTA/Mountaineers Reports:**
```bash
cd skills/route-researcher/tools
uv run python cloudscrape.py "{trip_report_url}"
```

**Extract and organize content by theme:**
- **Route:** Landmarks, variations, navigation, actual times/distances
- **Crux:** Difficulty assessments, technical requirements, conditions impact
- **Hazards:** Rockfall, exposure, route-finding challenges, seasonal hazards
- **Gear:** What people used/needed, seasonal variations
- **Conditions:** Snow/ice timing, trail conditions, best months

### Phase 5: Compile Results

1. **Ascent Statistics:** Total count, timeframe, monthly distribution
2. **Trip Reports Array:** All fetched reports with content organized by theme
3. **Browse All URLs:** Links to all discovered sources
4. **Information Gaps:**
   - WTA extraction failures
   - Mountaineers extraction failures
   - Limited trip reports (<5 total)
   - PeakBagger reports all brief (<100 words)
   - Specific reports that failed to fetch

## Error Handling

- **peakbagger-cli fails:** Fall back to WebSearch for trip reports
- **WTA AJAX endpoint fails:** Note in gaps, include WTA browse link
- **Mountaineers extraction fails:** Note in gaps, include browse link
- **Individual report fetch fails:** Continue with others, note which failed
- **No trip reports found:** Return empty array, include browse links
- **Minimum target:** Successfully fetch at least 5-8 reports

**Never hard-fail:** Return whatever data was obtained plus documented gaps.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Ascent statistics retrieved (or noted as unavailable)
- ✅ 10-15 trip reports successfully fetched (minimum 5-8)
- ✅ Content organized by themes (route, crux, hazards, gear, conditions)
- ✅ Browse all URLs collected
- ✅ Gaps documented
- ✅ Valid JSON output matching schema

## Tools Available

- Bash (for peakbagger-cli and cloudscrape.py)
- WebSearch (find trip report source pages)

## Notes

- **Word count not quality:** A concise 50-word report can be more valuable than 500-word narrative
- **Focus on substance:** Route beta, conditions, hazards are what matters
- **GPX tracks valuable:** Users can download and verify routes
- **Mix sources:** Don't just rely on PeakBagger - WTA often has more detail
- **Timeframe matters:** Adaptive approach based on peak popularity
- **Theme extraction:** Organize content to help synthesizer agent create focused sections
- **Representative sample:** 10-15 reports captures range of experiences without overwhelming
