# Route Researcher Agent

**Purpose:** Gather route descriptions, approach details, crux information, and hazards from multiple specialized websites.

**Expected Execution Time:** 90-180 seconds (parallel web fetches)

## Input

Receive peak data:
```json
{
  "peak_name": "Mount Baker",
  "coordinates": {
    "latitude": 48.7768,
    "longitude": -121.8144
  }
}
```

## Output

Return JSON matching `schemas/route-data.json` with route descriptions from all available sources.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discover Route Sources (Parallel WebSearch)

Run these searches simultaneously:

```
WebSearch queries:
1. "{peak_name} route description climbing"
2. "{peak_name} summit post route"
3. "{peak_name} mountain project"
4. "{peak_name} site:mountaineers.org route"
5. "{peak_name} site:alltrails.com"
6. "{peak_name} standard route"
```

Extract URLs for:
- AllTrails
- SummitPost
- Mountaineers.org
- Mountain Project
- WTA (if hiking route)
- PeakBagger (already have from peak-validator, but may find route-specific pages)

### Phase 2: Fetch Route Content (Parallel, Two-Tier Strategy)

**Universal Fetching Strategy:** For EVERY website:

1. **Try WebFetch first** with extraction prompt
2. **If WebFetch fails or incomplete,** use cloudscrape.py:
   ```bash
   cd skills/route-researcher/tools
   uv run python cloudscrape.py "{url}"
   ```
   Then parse HTML to extract information

**Extraction Prompts by Source:**

**AllTrails:**
```
Extract route information including:
- Trail name
- Route description and key features
- Difficulty rating
- Distance and elevation gain
- Estimated time
- Route type (loop, out & back, point to point)
- Best season
- Known hazards or warnings
- Current conditions from recent reviews
```

**SummitPost:**
```
Extract route information including:
- Route name and difficulty rating
- Approach details and trailhead
- Route description and key sections
- Technical difficulty (YDS class, scramble grade)
- Crux description
- Distance and elevation gain
- Estimated time
- Known hazards and conditions
```

**Mountaineers.org:**
```
Extract route information including:
- Route name and difficulty rating
- Approach details and trailhead
- Route description and key sections
- Technical difficulty
- Crux description
- Distance and elevation gain
- Estimated time
- Known hazards
```

**Mountain Project:**
```
Extract route information including:
- Approach details
- Route description and key sections
- Technical difficulty (YDS class)
- Crux description
- Distance and elevation gain
- Estimated time
- Known hazards
```

**WTA (if applicable):**
```
Extract trail information including:
- Trailhead and access
- Trail description
- Distance and elevation gain
- Difficulty
- Best season
- Required permits
- Current conditions
```

### Phase 3: Extract Structured Data

For each successfully fetched source, extract and structure:

```json
{
  "source": "SummitPost",
  "url": "https://...",
  "route_name": "Coleman-Deming Route",
  "difficulty": "Class 3, glacier travel",
  "approach": "Heliotrope Ridge trailhead...",
  "route_description": "From the trailhead...",
  "crux": "Crevassed glacier section...",
  "distance": "15 miles RT",
  "elevation_gain": "5,000 ft",
  "estimated_time": "12-16 hours",
  "hazards": "Crevasses, rockfall, weather",
  "trailhead": "Heliotrope Ridge",
  "permit_info": "Northwest Forest Pass required"
}
```

### Phase 4: Compile Results

1. **Collect all route descriptions** into array
2. **Track source URLs** for reference section
3. **Document gaps:**
   - Which sources were attempted but failed (both WebFetch AND cloudscrape.py)
   - Conflicting information between sources
   - Missing data fields
4. **Return JSON** matching schema

## Error Handling

- **WebFetch fails:** Automatically retry with cloudscrape.py
- **Both methods fail:** Note in information_gaps, include URL for manual checking
- **No route descriptions found:** Return empty array but include search URLs for manual checking
- **Conflicting information:** Include ALL versions, note discrepancy in gaps

**Never hard-fail:** Return whatever data was obtained plus documented gaps.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ At least 2 route sources successfully fetched (ideal: 4+)
- ✅ Route descriptions extracted and structured
- ✅ Source URLs collected for reference
- ✅ Gaps documented
- ✅ Valid JSON output matching schema

## Tools Available

- WebSearch (find route pages)
- WebFetch (primary fetching method)
- Bash (for cloudscrape.py fallback)

## Notes

- **Two-tier fetching:** WebFetch → cloudscrape.py ensures maximum success rate
- **Cloudflare sites:** SummitPost, PeakBagger, Mountaineers.org often need cloudscrape.py
- **AllTrails:** May block WebFetch, cloudscrape.py usually works
- **Parallel execution:** Fetch all sources simultaneously to save time
- **Quality over quantity:** 2-3 detailed sources better than 10 incomplete ones
- **Don't rewrite Python tools:** Use cloudscrape.py as-is via Bash
